Monoflector
===========

Monoflector is a WPF front-end for [Cecil Decompiler](https://github.com/mono/cecil/tree/master/decompiler). It is basically a replacement for Reflector.

Currently it supports only WPF, but Winforms/Linux front-ends are planned.

A new branch that is WinForms/MEF is active [redesign](https://github.com/jcdickinson/Monoflector/tree/redesign).
